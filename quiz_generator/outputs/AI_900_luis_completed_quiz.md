6. **Explain the importance of version control in large-scale LUIS applications.**
  
  Version control in LUIS is crucial for managing updates and changes efficiently in a collaborative development environment. It allows developers to track modifications made to the application while maintaining consistency. Additionally, it helps manage different iterations of the app, ensuring rollback options in case of errors or issues.

7. **Describe an example use case where LUIS could be applied in IoT device management.**
  
  A practical use case for LUIS in IoT device management would be using natural language to control smart home devices. For instance, a user might say, "Turn on the lights in the living room," and LUIS can identify the intent (control a device) and entity (living room lights) to execute the command via IoT platforms. This improves user experience with intuitive voice controls.
