  goal: >
    Read the JSON file containing quiz questions and the template file, then populate the template
    by replacing ALL placeholders with the exact content from the JSON file. Use ONLY the questions
    provided in the JSON - do not create additional questions. Maintain the exact number and order
    of questions as specified in the JSON file. PRESERVE the original numbering from the template
    exactly - do not renumber questions across sections.
