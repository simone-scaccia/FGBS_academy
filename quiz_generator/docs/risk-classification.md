# Risk Classification

*(Template refs: Annex IV Â¶2(f))*  

## Classification under the EU AI Act

The **Quiz Generator (CrewAI Flow)** is classified as a **Limited-risk AI system** according to the EU AI Act.  

### Rationale

- **Not High-Risk:**  
  The application does not fall under any of the high-risk categories listed in Annex III (e.g., biometric identification, education grading, recruitment, justice, critical infrastructures).  

- **Not Prohibited:**  
  The system does not perform subliminal manipulation, exploit vulnerabilities of specific groups, perform social scoring, or engage in real-time biometric surveillance.  

- **Limited Risk:**  
  The tool generates quizzes to support preparation for certification exams.  
  - Users are always aware they are interacting with AI (transparency obligation).  
  - A human review step is required before quiz distribution (oversight obligation).  
  - Potential risks are limited to inaccurate or ambiguous questions.  

- **Minimal Risk (not chosen):**  
  While the system could be argued as minimal-risk (similar to chatbots), we classify it conservatively as *Limited-risk* because the generated content may influence learning outcomes.

### Obligations

As a Limited-risk system, the main obligations are:  
- **Transparency:** clearly inform users that quiz content is AI-generated.  
- **Human oversight:** ensure quizzes are reviewed and approved before use in training or study.  
- **Error reporting:** maintain logs of errors and flows for traceability.
